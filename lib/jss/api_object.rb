module JSS

  # Classes
  #####################################

  # This class is the parent to all JSS API objects. It provides standard
  # methods and constants that apply to all API resouces.
  #
  # See the README.md file for general info about using subclasses of
  # JSS::APIObject
  #
  # == Subclassing
  #
  # === Initilize / Constructor
  #
  # All subclasses must call `super` in their initialize method, which will
  # call the method defined here in APIObject. Not only does this retrieve the
  # data from the API, it parses the raw JSON data into a Hash, & stores it in
  # @init_data.
  #
  # In general, subclasses should do any class-specific argument checking before
  # calling super, and then afterwards use the contents of @init_data to
  # populate any class-specific attributes. Populating @id, @name, @rest_rsrc,
  # and @in_jss are handled here.
  #
  # This class also handles parsing @init_data for any mixed-in modules, e.g.
  # Scopable, Categorizable or Extendable. See those modules for any
  # requirements they have when including them.
  #
  # === Object Creation
  #
  # If a subclass should be able to be created in the JSS be sure to include
  # {JSS::Creatable}
  #
  # The constructor should verify any extra required data in the args
  #
  # See {JSS::Creatable} for more details.
  #
  # === Object Modification
  #
  # If a subclass should be modifiable in the JSS, include {JSS::Updatable},
  # q.v. for details.
  #
  # === Object Deletion
  #
  # All subclasses can be deleted in the JSS.
  #
  # === Required Constants
  #
  # Subclasses *must* provide certain constants in order to correctly interpret
  # API data and communicate with the API:
  #
  # ==== RSRC_BASE [String]
  #
  # The base for REST resources of this class
  #
  # e.g. 'computergroups' in
  #   https://casper.mycompany.com:8443/JSSResource/computergroups/id/12
  #
  # ==== RSRC_LIST_KEY [Symbol]
  #
  # When GETting the RSRC_BASE for a subclass, an Array of Hashes is returned
  # with one Hash of basic info for each object of that type in the JSS. All
  # objects have their JSS id and name in that Hash, some have other data as
  # well. This Array is used for a variety of purposes when using ruby-jss,
  # since it gives you basic info about all objects, without having to fetch
  # each one individually.
  #
  # Here's the top of the output from the 'computergroups' RSRC_BASE:
  #
  #   {:computer_groups=>
  #     [{:id=>1020, :name=>"config-no-turnstile", :is_smart=>true},
  #      {:id=>1357, :name=>"10.8 Laptops", :is_smart=>true},
  #      {:id=>1094, :name=>"wifi_cert-expired", :is_smart=>true},
  #      {:id=>1144, :name=>"mytestgroup", :is_smart=>false},
  #      ...
  #
  # Notice that the Array we want is embedded in a one-item Hash, and the
  # key in that Hash for the desired Array is the Symbol :computer_groups.
  #
  # That symbol is the value needed in the RSRC_LIST_KEY constant.
  #
  # The '.all_ids', '.all_names' and other '.all_*' class methods use the
  # list-resource Array to extract other Arrays of the desired values - which
  # can be used to check for existance without retrieving an entire object,
  # among other uses.
  #
  # ==== RSRC_OBJECT_KEY [Symbol]
  #
  # The one-item Hash key used for individual JSON object output.  It's also
  # used in various error messages
  #
  # As with the list-resource output mentioned above, when GETting a specific
  # object resource, there's an extra layer of encapsulation in a one-item Hash.
  # Here's the top of the JSON for a single computer group fetched
  # from '...computergroups/id/1043'
  #
  #   {:computer_group=>
  #     {:id=>1043,
  #      :name=>"tmp-no-d3",
  #      :is_smart=>false,
  #      :site=>{:id=>-1, :name=>"None"},
  #      :criteria=>[],
  #      :computers=>[
  #      ...
  #
  # The data for the group itself is the inner Hash.
  #
  # The RSRC_OBJECT_KEY in this case is set to :computer_group - the key
  # in the top-level, one-item Hash that we need to get the real Hash about the
  # object.
  #
  # === Optional Constants
  #
  # === OTHER_LOOKUP_KEYS
  #
  # Fetching individual objects from the API is usuallly done via the object's
  # unique JSS id, via a resrouce URL like so:
  #
  #   ...JSSResource/<RSRC_BASE>/id/<idnumber>
  #
  # Most objects can also be looked-up by name, because the API also has
  # and endpoint ..JSSResource/<RSRC_BASE>/name/<name>
  # (See {NON_UNIQUE_NAMES} below)
  #
  # Some objects, like Computers and MobileDevices, have other values that
  # serve as unique identifiers and can also be used as 'lookup keys' for
  # fetching individual objects.  When this is the case, those values always
  # appear in the objects list-resource data (See {RSRC_LIST_KEY} above).
  #
  # For example, here's a summary-hash for a single MobileDevice from the
  # list-resource  '...JSSResource/mobiledevices', which you might get in the
  # Array returned by JSS::MobileDevice.all:
  #
  #   {
  #     :id=>3964,
  #     :name=>"Bear",
  #     :device_name=>"Bear",
  #     :udid=>"XXX",
  #     :serial_number=>"YYY2244MM60",
  #     :phone_number=>"510-555-1212",
  #     :wifi_mac_address=>"00:00:00:00:00:00",
  #     :managed=>true,
  #     :supervised=>false,
  #     :model=>"iPad Pro (9.7-inch Cellular)",
  #     :model_identifier=>"iPad6,4",
  #     :modelDisplay=>"iPad Pro (9.7-inch Cellular)",
  #     :model_display=>"iPad Pro (9.7-inch Cellular)",
  #     :username=>"fred"
  #   }
  #
  # For MobileDevices, serial_number, udid, and wifi_mac_address are also
  # all unique identifiers for an individual device, and can be used to
  # fetch them.
  #
  # To specify other identifiers for an APIObject subclass, create the constant
  # OTHER_LOOKUP_KEYS containing a Hash of Hashes, like so:
  #
  #   OTHER_LOOKUP_KEYS = {
  #      serial_number: {
  #        aliases: [:serialnumber, :sn],
  #        fetch_rsrc_key: :serialnumber
  #      },
  #      udid: {
  #        fetch_rsrc_key: :udid
  #      },
  #      wifi_mac_address: {
  #        aliases: [:macaddress, :macaddr],
  #        fetch_rsrc_key: :macaddress
  #      }
  #   }.freeze
  #
  # The keys in OTHER_LOOKUP_KEYS are the keys in a summary-hash data from .all
  # that hold a unique identifier. Each value is a Hash with one or two keys:
  #
  #   - aliases: [Array<Symbol>]
  #      Aliases for that identifier, i.e. abbreviations or spelling variants.
  #      These aliases can be used in fetching, and they also have
  #      matching `.all_<aliase>s` methods.
  #
  #      If no aliases are needed, don't specify anything, as with the udid:
  #      in the example above
  #
  #   - fetch_rsrc_key: [Symbol]
  #     Often a unique identifier can be used to build a URL for fetching (or
  #     updating or deleteing) an object with that value, rather than with id.
  #     For example, while the MobileDevice in the example data above would
  #     normally be fetched at the resource 'JSSResource/mobiledevices/id/3964'
  #     it can also be fetched at
  #    'JSSResource/mobiledevices/serialnumber/YYY2244MM60'.
  #     Since the URL is built using 'serialnumber', the symbol :serialnumber
  #     is used as the fetch_rsrc_key.
  #
  #     Setting a fetch_rsrc_key: for one of the OTHER_LOOKUP_KEYS tells ruby-jss
  #     that such a URL is available, and fetching by that lookup key will be
  #     faster when using that URL.
  #
  #     If a fetch_rsrc_key is not set, fetching will be slower, since the fetch
  #     method must first refresh the list of all available objects to find the
  #     id to use for building the resource URL.
  #     This is also true when fetching without specifying which lookup key to
  #     use, e.g. `.fetch 'foo'` vs. `.fetch sn: 'foo'`
  #
  # The OTHER_LOOKUP_KEYS, if defined, are merged with the DEFAULT_LOOKUP_KEYS
  # defined below via the {APIObject.lookup_keys} class method, They are used for:
  #
  # - creating list-methods:
  #   For each lookup key, a class method  `.all_<key>s` is created
  #   automatically, e.g. `.all_serial_numbers`. The aliases are used to
  #   make alises of those methods, e.g. `.all_sns`
  #
  # - finding valid ids:
  #   The {APIObject.valid_id} class method looks at the known lookup keys to
  #   find an object's id.
  #
  # - fetching:
  #   When an indentifier is given to `.fetch`, the fetch_rsrc_key is used to
  #   build the resource URL for fetching the object. If there is no
  #   fetch_rsrc_key, the lookup_keys and aliases are used to find the matching
  #   id, which is used to build the URL.
  #
  #   When no identifier is specified, .fetch uses .valid_id, described above.
  #
  # ==== NON_UNIQUE_NAMES
  #
  # Some JSS objects, like Computers and MobileDevices, do not treat names
  # as unique in the JSS, but they can still be used for fetching objects.
  # The API itself will return data for a non-unique name lookup, but there's
  # no way to guarantee which object you get back.
  #
  # In those subclasses, set NON_UNIQUE_NAMES to any value, and a
  # JSS::AmbiguousError exception will be raised when trying to fetch by name
  # and the name isn't unique.
  #
  # Because of the extra processing, the check for this state will only happen
  # when NON_UNIQUE_NAMES is set. If not set at all, the check  doesn't happen
  # and if multiple objects have the same name, which one is returned is
  # undefined.
  #
  # When that's the case, fetching explicitly by name, or when fetching with a
  # plain search term that matches a non-unique name, will raise a
  # JSS::AmbiguousError exception,when the name isn't unique. If that happens,
  # you'll have to use some other identifier to fetch the desired object.
  #
  # Note: Fetching, finding valid id, and name collisions are case-insensitive.

    # Class Methods
    #####################################

    # What are all the lookup keys available for this class, with
    # all their aliases (or optionally not) or with their fetch_rsrc_keys
    #
    # This method combines the DEFAULT_LOOOKUP_KEYS defined above, with the
    # optional OTHER_LOOKUP_KEYS from a subclass (See 'Lookup Keys' in the
    # class comments/docs above)
    #
    # The hash returned flattens and inverts the two source hashes, so that
    # all possible lookup keys (the keys and their aliases) are hash keys
    # and the non-aliased lookup key is the value.
    #
    # For example, when
    #
    #   OTHER_LOOKUP_KEYS = {
    #      serial_number: { aliases: [:serialnumber, :sn], fetch_rsrc_key: :serialnumber },
    #      udid: { fetch_rsrc_key: :udid },
    #      wifi_mac_address: { aliases: [:macaddress, :macaddr], fetch_rsrc_key: :macaddress }
    #   }
    #
    # It is combined with DEFAULT_LOOKUP_KEYS to produce:
    #
    #   {
    #     id: :id,
    #     name: :name,
    #     serial_number: :serial_number,
    #     serialnumber: :serial_number,

    #     macaddress: :wifi_mac_address,
    #     macaddr: :wifi_mac_address
    #   }
    #
    # If the optional parameter no_aliases: is truthy, only the real keynames
    # are returned in an array, so the above would become
    #
    #   [:id, :name, :serial_number, :udid, :wifi_mac_address]
    #
    # @param no_aliases [Boolean] Only return the real keys, no aliases.
    #

    # Return an Array of Hashes for all objects of this subclass in the JSS.
    #
    # This method is only valid in subclasses of JSS::APIObject, and is
    # the parsed JSON output of an API query for the resource defined in the
    # subclass's RSRC_BASE
    #
    # e.g. for JSS::Computer, with the RSRC_BASE of :computers,
    # This method retuens the output of the 'JSSResource/computers' resource,
    # which is a list of all computers in the JSS.
    #
    # Each item in the Array is a Hash with at least two keys, :id and :name.
    # The class methods .all_ids and .all_names provide easier access to those
    # dataas mapped Arrays.
    #
    # Some API classes provide other keys in each Hash, e.g. :udid (for
    # computers and mobile devices) or :is_smart (for groups).
    #
    # For those keys that are listed in a subclass's lookup_keys method,
    # there are matching methods `.all_(key)s` which return an array
    # just of those values, from the values of this hash. For example,
    # `.all_udids` will use the .all array to return an array of just udids,
    # if the subclass defines :udid in its OTHER_LOOKUP_KEYS (See 'Lookup Keys'
    # in the class comments/docs above)
    #
    # Subclasses should provide appropriate .all_xxx class methods for accessing
    # any other other values as Arrays, e.g. JSS::Computer.all_managed
    #
    # -- Caching
    #
    # The results of the first call to .all for each subclass is cached in the
    # .object_list_cache of the given {JSS::APIConnection} and that cache is
    # used for all future calls, so as to not requery the server every time.
    #
    # To force requerying to get updated data, provided a truthy argument.
    # I usually use :refresh, so that it's obvious what I'm doing, but true, 1,
    # or anything besides false or nil will work.
    #
    # The various methods that use the output of this method also take the
    # refresh parameter which will be passed here as needed.
    #
    # -- Alternate API connections
    #
    # To query an APIConnection other than the currently active one,
    # provide one via the api: named parameter.
    #
    # @param refresh[Boolean] should the data be re-queried from the API?
    #
    # @param api[JSS::APIConnection] an API connection to use for the query.
    #   Defaults to the corrently active API. See {JSS::APIConnection}

    # Return a hash of all objects of this subclass
    # in the JSS where the key is the id, and the value
    # is some other key in the data items returned by the JSS::APIObject.all.
    #
    # If the other key doesn't exist in the API summary data from .all
    # (eg :udid for JSS::Department) the values will be nil.
    #
    # Use this method to map ID numbers to other identifiers returned
    # by the API list resources. Invert its result to map the other
    # identfier to ids.
    #
    # @example
    #   JSS::Computer.map_all_ids_to(:serial_number)
    #
    #   # Returns, eg {2 => "C02YD3U8JHD3", 5 => "VMMz7xgg8lYZ"}
    #
    #   JSS::Computer.map_all_ids_to(:serial_number).invert
    #
    #   # Returns, eg {"C02YD3U8JHD3" => 2, "VMMz7xgg8lYZ" => 5}
    #
    # These hashes are cached separately from the .all data, and when
    # the refresh parameter is truthy, both will be refreshed.
    #
    # WARNING: Some values in the output of .all are not guaranteed to be unique
    # in Jamf Pro. This is fine in the direct output of this method, each id
    # will be the key for some value and many ids might have the same value.
    # However if you invert that hash, the values become keys, and the ids
    # become the values, and there can be only one id per each new key. Which
    # id becomes associated with a value is undefined, and data about the others
